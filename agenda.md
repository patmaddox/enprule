 9:15AM Discussion: Why & How of Pairing

        Q1) Why do we pair? 
        
        A large group discussion in understanding pairing
        The point of the discussion is to get the group to come up with
        advantages of pairing that drive toward advantages of cross-skill
        pairing. 
        
        - Efficiency
        - Learning
        - Built-in review
        
        Q2) For each item on that list, how does it apply if pairing
        with someone with a totally different background from you?
        E.g. dev-tester; dev-designer; tester-designer. Sample answer:
        
        - if a dev-designer pair, it's both a built-in code review
        AND a built-in design review. 

        - if a test-dev pair, it's a built-in code review and a 
        collaboration that results in better tests than either might
        produce on their own.

        Q3) How do we pair?

        There are numerous styles of pairing on code:
        - Ping Pong
        - Ball and Board
        - Driver/Navigator

        Consider how these might apply to pairing on something other
        than code.
        
 9:45AM Exercise: First Pairing

        0) Pairing mindfully: noticing what others bring

        1) Find a pair - find someone with nothing in common with you
 
        2) Pairku: pairing on Haiku

        3) Debrief: what did you notice?

10:30AM Discussion: The Broken Comb Model

        Everyone brings something to the table. 
        Everyone is a unique collection of skills, experiences,
        values, and concerns. Discovering that which is
        not on the surface can help you collaborate better.

10:45AM Exercise: Building Agreement

11:30AM Introducing "Deliverables: a simulation"
