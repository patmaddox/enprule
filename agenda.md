        Stories:
          - Elisabeth: paired exploring/automating on Bringlight

          - Elisabeth: paired CSS/SASS with Entaggle designer
          
        Why do we pair? 
        
        A large group discussion in understanding pairing
        The point of the discussion is to get the group to come up with
        advantages of pairing that drive toward advantages of cross-skill
        pairing. 
        
        Q1: Why do we pair at all? Sample answers:
        
        - Efficiency
        - Learning
        - Built-in review
        
        Q2: For each item on that list, how does it apply if pairing
        with someone with a totally different background from you?
        E.g. dev-tester; dev-designer; tester-designer. Sample answer:
        
        - if a dev-designer pair, it's both a built-in code review
        AND a built-in design review. 
        
 9:30AM Find a pair - find someone with nothing in common with you
