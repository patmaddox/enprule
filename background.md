“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”

The term "non-coder" is terrible. It places the emphasis on what someone can't do 
instead of what they can.

This session is about figuring out how to collaborate with people who have a completely
different skillset from you.

# Pairing Styles

In traditional pairing on coding tasks there are a variety of pairing patterns:

- Ping Pong: one writes a test and one writes the code
- Driver/Navigator: one types the other dictates
- Ball and Board: one has the mouse, the other has the keybaord
- name? standard Pivotal style: fluid hand-off of control based on itch to type

But how does that map to pairs with wildly different skills and experiences?

- Least qualified drives: like Driver/Navigator - but the navigator is always the person with the least experience in the given area. E.g. if pairing dev - designer and they're working in photoshop, the designer navigates and the dev drives. Good for forcing knowledge sharing. Best in a high-trust environment, otherwise performance anxiety can make it too intimidating for the driver.

- Ping Pong: a variation on ping-ponging on tests substituting questions for assertions about the code. E.g. one asks a question: "How will we make sure X is covered?" and the other creates the content that covers X. Particularly useful when producing non-executable content such as documentation.

- Ball and Board still applies -- but may feel less like a mechanism to create fluidity and more like a three legged race where one partner is tied to another who has no idea what they're doing.
