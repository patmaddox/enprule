# Pairku

Warm up to pairing / collaborate on a verse / minds meld and blossom

Pairku is a pairing warm up exercise created by Dale Emery and Elisabeth Hendrickson. 

The rules are simple: pair with someone to write one or more haikus (a non-rhyming 3-line poem following the structure 5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables).

As you pair, be mindful. Things to notice:

* Am I listening to my pair? Am I incorporating the suggestions my pair makes?
* Do I feel like my pair is listening to me? Is my pair taking my suggestions?
* Am I willing to let go of an idea I have in favor of my pair's idea?
* Am I willing to change direction in favor of my pair's vision?
* Am I able to stand up for my ideas without being inflexible?
* Is my pair offering ideas that I would never have thought of?
* Can I see ways that working with a pair results in something more creative, better?

For additional complexity, try experimenting with different styles of pairing:

* Ping Pong: take turns offering the next word
* Ball and Board: if working on a computer, one of you take the mouse and the other takes the keyboard
* Navigator/Driver: one of you has reference material such as a thesaurus or dictionary (navigator); the other has control of the editor (driver)
