# Find a Pair

Since the whole point of this workshop is to explore pairing with people who
have diverse skillsets, the very first team exercise involves finding a pair (or triple) where the members have as little in common as possible.

We could do this with advertised strengths - and a mental map of your own weaknesses.

Instructions to participants: take a mental inventory of what you bring to the table. Write a card advertising just your strengths. You do not need to advertise your perceived weaknesses -- just bear them in mind. Now go around the room and shop for a pair who's strengths fill your perceived weaknesses.

We could help with the mental inventory of skills by projecting a list of skills relevant to software development:

- Programming
- Graphic design
- Interaction design
- Requirements analysis
- Automated testing
- Exploratory testing
- Security
- Operations / System Administration
- ...
